&hWelcome to the &dBliss Modpack&r.
&cPlease read all the following before starting:&r

&hGameplay

The Bliss Modpack is designed for &dPeaceful&r style gameplay, without having to play in Peaceful. In essence:
- Mobs will not attack you unless provoked first
- Mobs do not spawn in any places that can see the sky
- Spiders do not spawn at all, but cave spider spawners are still available
- Guarding Mobs (Illagers and Piglin Brutes) will still attack unprovoked
- Zombies always turn Villagers to Zombie Villagers, even on Normal difficulty
- In &cHard&r or &cHardcore&r difficulty, mobs will regain their ability to aggress!

&hShaders
&dBliss&r contains a customized version of the &aComplementary Shaders&r pack, with changes made to our preferences with the intent of making the shader look better match the vanilla look. Please note that these changes are ours and not endorsed by the Complementary team, and as such, they are not representative of their design.

Shaders are enabled by default, and can be disabled, or reset to one of the official Complementary presets in Video Settings > Shader Packs.

&cWarning&r: If you are using an M1 model Mac or MacBook, shaders will not function and you have to turn them off before starting the game.

Complementary is created by EminGTR and can be found here:

&hMusic
&dBliss&r contains a dynamic soundtrack, which changes based on various ingame aspects, such as what biome you're on, depth, or even if you're close to your bed. All of these songs are sourced from D. C. Kariri Sawler's &aAdventurer's Journey&r, and take over the vanilla music. Do consider playing with music on for the full experience!

&hDocumentation
After you create a world, in your player's inventory, the &dBliss Guide&r will be always available, taking over the vanilla Recipe Book. The guide pauses the game while open, so we highly recommend you take a bit of time to survey its content, so you know all the pack has to offer.

&hGuidebook Beta
I'll be putting all of this junk in the book later but just take it here for now so you know:
- Press N ingame to open the notes menu its good trust me yes
- Use your Sneak/Shift key to hold onto walls, you can even wall jump after doing that
- Quark recipes for iron rods and backpack are now easy so go check those out
- Snow Golems can deal damage to Withers so you can make a ton of them to kill it

Most of what else is in the book is just copied from Crucial 2. Expect more Gossip, Vanilla Tweaks, and some entries being unlocked further in via advancements.

Enjoy!
